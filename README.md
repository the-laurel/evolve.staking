# Evolve With Us

We are volunteers from The Laurel Project who offer staking/validation services for select blockchains.

We present our contributions in ideas, effort, and assets for evolving the Evmos, Cosmos, and blockchain space. See our video:

When you stake your tokens with us you know:
- the earned commission will be used for building new tech
- we enable volunteer developers to have enough gas to deploy their contracts
- our demos and video presentations are supported by your trust in us
