# Evolve With Us

We are volunteers from The Laurel Project who offer staking/validation services for select blockchains.

We present our contributions in ideas, effort, and assets for evolving the EVM, CosmWasm, Cosmos, and blockchain space. 

When you stake your tokens with us you know:
- the earned commission will be used for building new tech
- we enable volunteer developers to have enough gas to deploy their contracts
- our demos and video presentations are supported by your trust in us

We currently restake 100% of the rewards for securing the networks and maintaining voting power.

### Evmos

**[UPDATE 2022/December/01]: The Evmos Governance Council has decided to NOT consider our efforts as volunteer efforts: [https://youtu.be/eQjt8UxFRZ4?t=2773](https://youtu.be/eQjt8UxFRZ4?t=2773). We have volunteered > 100h/week for Evmos, as detailed below. We have spent 2h/week maintaining the evmos4volunteers validator, which can be considered a for-profit activity, even though the rewards have not been used as money. Therefore, we can no longer volunteer for Evmos, because the volunteer status cannot exist if the person/project/institution you are helping does not consider you one.**
